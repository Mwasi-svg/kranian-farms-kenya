    slug: "seasonal-eating-why-it-matters",
    excerpt: "Explore the benefits of eating seasonally and how it can improve your health while supporting local agriculture.",
    content: `
      <p>Eating seasonally means consuming fruits and vegetables that are naturally harvested during specific times of the year in your local area. This ancient practice is gaining renewed attention as people discover its numerous benefits.</p>
      
      <h2>Health Benefits of Seasonal Eating</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Peak Nutrition:</strong> Seasonal produce is harvested at its nutritional peak, providing maximum vitamins and minerals.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Taste:</strong> Fruits and vegetables taste better when they're in season and haven't traveled long distances.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety in Diet:</strong> Seasonal eating naturally encourages dietary diversity throughout the year.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Effective:</strong> In-season produce is typically more affordable due to local abundance.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
      <p>Choosing seasonal produce reduces the environmental footprint of your food. Local, seasonal crops require less transportation, packaging, and artificial preservation, leading to lower carbon emissions.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Seasonal Calendar</h2>
      <p>At Kranian Farms, we provide our customers with a seasonal calendar that highlights what's fresh each month. This helps you plan meals around the freshest, most nutritious options available.</p>

      <h3>Summer (June-August)</h3>
      <p>Tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, berries, and stone fruits</p>
      
      <h3>Fall (September-November)</h3>
      <p>Apples, pumpkins, squash, and root vegetables</p>
      
      <h3>Winter (December-February)</h3>
      <p>Citrus fruits, stored apples, and preserved vegetables</p>
      
      <p>By aligning your eating habits with nature's rhythm, you'll discover new flavors, support your local ecosystem, and enjoy the freshest food possible.</p>

    excerpt: "A beginner's guide to starting your own herb garden with tips and tricks from our experienced farmers.",
    content: `
      <p>Growing your own herbs is one of the most rewarding gardening experiences. Fresh herbs not only enhance your cooking but also provide natural remedies and beautiful fragrances for your home.</p>
      
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>Starting an herb garden is easier than you might think. Here's what you need to know:</p>
      
      <h3>Choose Your Location</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Most herbs need 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily</li>
        <li><strong>Drainage:</strong> Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Plant herbs where you can easily harvest them for cooking</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Essential Herbs for Beginners</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basil:</strong> Perfect for Italian dishes and easy to grow</li>
        <li><strong>Rosemary:</strong> Hardy perennial that's great with roasted meats</li>
        <li><strong>Thyme:</strong> Low-maintenance and adds flavor to many dishes</li>
        <li><strong>Parsley:</strong> Fast-growing and versatile for cooking</li>
        <li><strong>Mint:</strong> Grows vigorously (plant in containers to control spread)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Planting Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with seedlings for faster results</li>
        <li>Space plants according to their mature size</li>
        <li>Use quality potting soil for container gardens</li>
        <li>Water regularly but don't overwater</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Harvesting and Storage</h2>
      <p>The key to a productive herb garden is regular harvesting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Harvest in the morning after dew has dried</li>
        <li>Cut stems just above a leaf pair to encourage growth</li>
        <li>Don't harvest more than 1/3 of the plant at once</li>
        <li>Dry herbs in small bundles or freeze in ice cube trays with oil</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Common Problems and Solutions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pests:</strong> Use companion planting with marigolds to deter insects</li>
        <li><strong>Disease:</strong> Ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Growth:</strong> Check soil pH and nutrient levels</li>
